# Black Peak Expedition

Nestled in the supernatural mountain ranges of the Garhwal region in Uttarakhand, the Black Peak, also revered as "Kala Nag" by locals, stands as a monumental challenge for avid mountaineers. The mountain's distinct cobra-hood-like appearance and dark shadow cast its mystique across the Saraswati mountain range, which includes other notable peaks such as Saraswati Devi Parvat and Hanuman Parvat. Starting from Sankri, the Black Peak Expedition ascends to a staggering 6,387 m (20,960 feet), traversing through the enchanting Ruinsara Tal and entering a realm of sprawling glaciers and iconic snow ranges like Bandarpoonch and Swargarohini. This journey culminates on the tenth day at Black Peak within the bounds of Govind National Park, a site first conquered by Jack Gibson in 1955.
                      Designed for the experienced trekker, this expedition offers a thrilling and adventurous trek across rugged, rocky, and deserted paths. The journey involves navigating curvy routes with inclines ranging from 60 to 75 degrees, over rivers, and at dizzying heights of over 2000 feet. With no villages or farms post-Ruinsara Tal, trekkers rely entirely on their guides, making it an actual test of endurance and thrill for adventure seekers.

## Detailed Itinerary

Day 1: Make your way to Sankri
Our journey to Black Peak starts from Dehradun, and after driving 185 km, we reach Sankri. Sankari is our first stop, where we get after a 10- to 11-hour drive. This small village in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand is the first stop point for many treks like Kedarkantha, Har Ki Doon, Baradsar Lake, Bali Pass, Dev Kyara, Phulara Ridge, etc. We leave Dehradun at 7 am, passing winding roads, terraced fields, hills, and villages. We reach Sankri at 6-7 p.m. The altitude of Sankri is 1,950 meters above sea level. You may get altitude sickness while reaching here. For this, you must inform the trek guide or the staff in the vehicle

Day 2: Sankri to Seema via Taluka
On the second day of trekking, we will leave Sankri and go to Taluka, or while trekking from there, we will stay at Seema, our campsite. At 7 am, we will prepare for the trek, where the trek guide will tell us about the do's and don'ts during the trek, and after having breakfast until 9 am, we will leave for the drive-through for the trek. Today's trekking will consist of a 3-hour drive from Sankri to Taluka. In this, we will cover 12 kms. Taluka is a spot where famous treks start, like Har Ki Doon. From here, we will trek to the border, which gets covered in 11–12 hours. During this, you will see many streams joining the Supin River and roaring forests, and you can enjoy Maggi and local sweets at small stalls on the way. You can enjoy a packed lunch during the trek, reach the campsite at 6–7 pm, enjoy dinner, and spend the night there

Day 3: Seema to Ruinsara Tal
On the third day of the trek, we will leave the border and begin the 7-8 km trek to Ruinsara Tal, which will take 14-15 hours. Ruinsara Tal is 3,500 meters above sea level and has mythological significance. It is said that the Pandavas came there to leave for heaven while going to the Swargarohini mountain range via Ruinsara Tal. When you come to this place, you will feel very relaxed. The blue water here will make you feel connected to this environment. I will stay in this compound tonight and spend the day gazing at the stars in the open sky

Day 4: Ruinsara Tal to Kyarkoti Base Camp
From Ruinsara camp, you will leave for the Kyarkoti campus. It will take us 5-6 hours to cross it. In this sequence, you will see Black Peak. Today's route will pass through the green meadows, where giant boulders will also be seen ahead. In this route, you will see an adventure trail where you must climb and move forward. As the trek guide says, it would help if you decided with extensive teamwork

Day 5: Rest and Acclimatization at Base camp
Today's day will be spent on this trek site. It can also be called rest day, which is necessary to get used to. You have come here after crossing 2,000 meters from the narrow to Kyarkoti pass, where the chances of altitude sickness are very high, or, at the same time, the route ahead is more challenging. For this, there is a great need for mental or physical rest, which you will get on this day

Day 6: Base Camp to Base Camp Advance
We will go from Base Camp to the Advance Campsite (4,500 m/14,800 ft). Here, the path will be narrow, and footpaths will not be made, making the path tiring and risky. The oxygen level keeps decreasing as we go higher, and breathing becomes difficult. In such a situation, you must move forward comfortably with small steps. Proper rest is also to be taken in between. If you have a lot of luggage or cannot carry it, then the trek guide can suggest the mules before the start of the trek. While going to the advanced base camp site, you will see the river flowing below and go through the top of the mountains because the way is thin, and you may need to help walking diagonally on small flats, mud, and mountain slides. You can see the peak of Black Peak and Bandarpunch at the halfway point, which dares you to move on

Day 7: Rest and Acclimatization Day
Today is a rest day because from here, a lot of change in altitude and temperature starts, and the body needs a lot of acclimatization. Breathing exercises, how to use mountain tools while trekking, and other activities are done here as per the instructions of the trek guide so that it is easy to cross the path ahead

Day 8: Advanced Base Camp to Camp 1It is an exciting day because the landscape will change from here. The altitude will change from 4,500 m/14,800 ft to 5050 m/ 16,550 ft. Today, we enter Glacier Land from Moraine Land, the campsite. Today's climb is very tough, which can bring you down, so it is advised to move forward with teamwork in small steps. After walking some distance, the peak becomes fully visible, which is quite a thrilling sight

Day 9: Camp 1 to Summit Camp
Today's trek reaches a height of 18,050 feet while covering 450 meters in 3 kilometers. Now, we do not have any resources, so we pass the day by making water from snow. One can also directly see the big crack on the glacier, which results from global warming and is called a crevasse. With the help of this crevasse, today we move forward with the help of rope. Only professional trekkers are capable of undertaking this trek. Dhundar Kandy Pass is also clearly visible to you from this height

Day 10: Summit Camp to Summit Attempt
We start the trek at 2 am to reach the summit. The temperature is harsh and between -5 and -10 degrees. Climb at a 70 to 75-degree angle where you need to use the rope. Walking on that kind of slope will take a lot of work. We cover 3 km in 7-8 hours due to the vertical angle wall and cover almost 890m/ 2900ft daily. We will climb and descend in a day, so it will take 15-16 hours, which means it's a hectic and tiring day for trekkers. We will climb 6387 m/ 20950 ft from sea level in total

Day 11: Summit Camp to Kyarkoti Camp
Now, we are returning from summit camp to base camp. It takes 7-8 hours, and we cover 10 km in a day. It's a high-altitude decline of approximately 1000m /3300ft. On the front side, we will see the peak of Swargarohini peaks, and in the back, Bandar Punch and Black Peak

Day 12: Kyarkoti base camp to Ruinsara Tal
After breakfast, we descend back to Ruinsara Tal, where the temperature will be higher than in the glacier region. The altitude here is up to 3,600m /11,800ft, and the difference in altitude is 900m/2950ft. You will feel comfortable breathing here because you are now in the meadows. We cover a distance of 7 km, which takes around 4-5 hours. Due to the rocky trail and the slope of up to 60 degrees angle, there is a lot of difficulty in getting down, so there is a need to get down carefully

Day 13: Ruinsara Tal to Seema
After breakfast, we start the journey from Ruinsara Tal to return to the Seema. It is a 17-km journey that takes around 8-9 hours. We descend to an altitude difference of 2,600 m/8,600 ft and then back down to 1,000 m/3,300 ft. This is our last campsite. We rest here and enjoy the memories of our achievements and trek experience

Day 14: Seema to Taluka and drive to Sankri
At 8 am, we start the trek to return to Taluka. During this, we cover a height of 2000m/6700ft and an altitude difference of 650m/2100ft. After reaching the taluka, a vehicle is waiting for us. We again come to Sankri (1950m/6400ft) and spend the day at the homestay, getting rid of the tiredness of the entire trek. The journey as a whole is around 12 km and takes 4-5 hours

Day 15: Depart from Sankri
Here, our expedition ends, and with the memories of this adventurous trek, we leave for Dehradun after saying goodbye to Sankri after breakfast. On the way, the driver stops the car in a restaurant to eat where you eat at your expense. We will reach Dehradun around 11 pm through the drive. This journey will last 10-11 hours

Day 16: Reserve Day
This day is like a reserve day, so if there is a shortage of days during this expedition, it can be made up. That's why you should book your return home ticket keeping every possibility in mind.
