# Hampta Pass Trek

Deep inside the mystic regions of Kullu, Himachal Pradesh lies the enchanting Hampta Pass. It's a complete trek with its contrasting landscape of flowers, waterfalls, streams, and forests of Kullu valley on one side and a vast expanse of dry and desolate mountains of the Lahaul valley on the other. The journey comprises of 5 days and 22 km with minimal ascends and descends, mild showers, and a surprising change in scenery. In the first two days of the journey, we are accompanied by the gorgeous Rani nallah. On the third day, after a few exciting river crossings, we start ascending towards the pass which is nestled at a height of 4,200 meters. The trek finally ends at the charming high altitude lake that goes by the name of Chandra Tal lake. This turquoise blue lake is situated at a height of 4,250 meters and is best known for its serenity and splendor. The ideal time to do this trek is from June to October when the magic of monsoon rains give life to a wide pallet of flowers and colours.

## Detailed Itinerary

Day 1: Drive for 6 - 7 HRS from DEHRADUN - SANKRI
The first boarding point is the Manali bus stand. The scheduled time to report there is 9 AM. The journey begins at 10 AM. We drive to Jobra through Prini. The 16 kilometers of drive which takes up to 1 hour takes us through sharp curves and bends. Three kilometers from the Manali bus stand, the roads gain height and lead towards the mountains through Prini. As we gain height, we witness the massive Beas River flowing through the vibrant Manali city in the valley below us. The view of Manali soon fades as we drive forward and a stream of smooth clouds envelope the massive landscape around us. While driving through the clouds we can see huge pine and small apple trees accompanying us on both sides of the road. An hour later, we reach Jobra which is situated right next to the famous Allain Duhangan Hydropower Plant.
          Trek from Jobra (2,743M) to Chikka (3,048M)
          The actual trek for Hampta Pass begins from Jobra. After settling down in Jobra, we start walking through a lush green forest filled with maple, deodar, and oak trees. This day is easy as we cover a distance of 3 kilometers in 2 hours. After a few minutes into the trail, small streams of the Rani nalllah accompany us on our left. Then, we cross a rustic wooden bridge and continue walking beneath the trees for the next 1.5 km. At the end of the forest line, the trail opens up to the valley towards Chikka. From here, the path gradually ascends and is lined with moist logs and boulders on either side. After 2 kilometers, the landscape reveals its many surprises. There are small flowers and shrubs alongside the river and horses by the dozen grazing through the shrubs in free spirit. Our first campsite of the trek, Chikka, is at the end of this elevation (about 3 kms from here)

Day 2: Kafnu to Mulling (10 Kms/ 5-6 Hrs)
Today, we cover a distance of 5 kilometers in 7-8 hours and gain a bit more altitude (600 meters). After an early start at around 8 AM, we cross a small wooden bridge and begin our ascent. Because of the persistent and unpredictable rains, the first 2 kilometers of moderate ascend are likely to be filled with mud and slush. A little further into the trail, the flow of Rani nallah changes towards the right-hand side. There’s something very refreshing about water bouncing off the small boulders lined along the stream, its sprinkles hitting us in the face taking away the fatigue that comes with walking on the trail. We experience the first river crossing of the trek after 2.5 kilometers. This river crossing is a gateway to the colorful meadows of Jwara, a huge stretch packed with flowers that boast of all the hues of the colour spectrum. Lunch break at Jwara is equivalent to a picnic at a park. The trail from Jwara gets easy with minimal ascends and runs closer to the river. It turns completely flat 4 kms from here. On the right-hand side of the track, you can spot small pockets of land between the water stream with unusual orchids and small birds. This magical pathway leads us straight towards Balu Ka Ghera, the second campsite

Day 3: Balu Ka Ghera to Siagoru crossing Hampta Pass
This is the longest and toughest day of the trek. Today, we cover a distance of 9 kilometers in 7 hours and gain an altitude of 600 meters. Early in the morning, we leave Balu Ka Ghera at 6:30 AM and walk along the Rani nallah. For 1 kilometer, the trails are paved in a zigzag manner because of the huge boulders. After a while, the valley opens up and a huge frame of the river runs parallel with us. When we cross 2 kilometers, the trails get steeper and steeper with heavy ascents and turns. The higher we climb, the thinner the river becomes. The last source of fresh water and greenery ends at the 3km mark and a dry trail of snow and rock begins. The path on the snow is vigorous and the weather is likely to be unpredictable for the next kilometer. Hampta Pass lies at the end of this trail. The pass is a small stretch that leads us to Lahaul. The trails directly descend with a 50-degree steep slope from the pass. This descent continues for the next 3 km. Loose sand, mud, and big boulders can make the stretch challenging to navigate during rains. The trail offers you some relief once you cross this stretch for the final 2 kms is flat and straight. It leads us directly towards Shea Goru, the third campsite

Day 4: Siagoru to Chatru
The second river crossing of the trek happens on the glacial stream near the campsite. Crossing through the river from Shea Goru is one of the most adventurous assets of the Hampta Pass trek. On this day, we cover a distance of 5 kilometers in 4 hours. We cross the river around 7 AM and start descending downwards. The powerful Chandra river rushes on our left-hand side. Expect to reach the campsite, Chhatru, around 11 AM.
          At Chhatru, we assemble in the nearest roadway and start driving towards the stunning Chandra Tal Lake. It takes 3 hours and 70 kilometers to reach the lake. The incomplete roads, dangerous curves, flowing streams make for a complete off-road driving experience. Throughout the drive, you can witness the marvelous snowcapped Spiti range on both sides of the road. The serene lake is situated at a height of 4,250 meters and after a brief stop, we return to our campsite in Chhatru by night.
          Note – The route to Chandra Tal Lake is prone to landslides. In case of any such news, the drive will be canceled

Day 5: Final Day Chatru to Manali
On the final day, we pack and leave early for Manali by around 7 AM. The distance between Chhatru and Manali is 60 km and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to reach the Manali bus stand. On the way, while we exit Spiti, we find many army tents and small check posts. Close to 45 minutes into the drive, we enter the infamous Atal tunnel. We reach the final stop before noon; you may plan your return journey accordingly.
