# Kashmir Great Lakes Trek

Kashmir, a phrase that conjures up a thousand feelings of love, grandeur, exoticism, and, in Firdaus’ terms, “heaven.” Some say it’s a paradise on earth, while others say it’s a paradise by itself, but Kashmir truly stands out among the world’s most beautiful places. The lakes around here, whether Dal Lake, Vishansar Lake, or the Gangabal Twin Lakes, are surreal and a rare sight. We discover the most pristine mix of alpine lakes, far-reaching meadows, high altitude passes, and vast unexplored vistas of Kashmir Himalayas on the Kashmir Great Lakes Trek. As the saying goes, once you visit Kashmir, your heart will never leave. The KGL trek is a perfect example of the state's natural beauty.

## Detailed Itinerary

Day 1: Receive from airport to Shitkari Base Camp
Upon arrival at Srinagar airport, board a vehicle for a three-hour drive to Shitkari, through winding roads that lead to Kashmir's golden meadows of Sonamarg. Shitkari is our base camp for the Kashmir Lakes Trek, and it is located 3 kilometers before Sonamarg. Stay overnight in tents at the open grassy campsite at Shitkari

Day 2: Trek from Base Camp to Nichnaie
We begin our trek to Nichnai early in the morning, aiming for a 2 to 3-hour moderate ascent to the tabletop village of Shekdur, passing through a stretch of pine forests before arriving at the bank of Nichnai Nallah for lunch. We arrive at today's campsite after a gradual climb along the Nallah, with breathtaking views of the Nichnai Pass ahead

Day 3: Trek from Nichnaie to Vishnusar
The day's trek begins with a 2-hour moderate to a steep climb to the top of Nichnai Pass (4100 m). While ascending towards the pass, we can see the Nichnai lake on the left side. After crossing the pass, we descend for an hour and re-group for lunch before walking through the valley meadows to today's campsite, which is located just below the Vishnusar lake. The rest of the day can be spent exploring the surrounding area. Visiting the Vishnusar and Kishansar twin lakesDay 4: Trek from Vishnusar to GadsarWe begin the day by ascending gradually across the twin lakes. Following a steep climb to the top of Gadsar pass at 4200 m, which offers spectacular views of the twin lakes, a gradual descent follows, followed by a simple walk along the meadows towards Gadsar lake. We re-group at the lake for lunch before going on to the campsite further ahead

Day 5: Trek from Gadsar to satsar
Today's trek takes us through SATSAR, a series of seven lakes. We hike uphill from Gadsar campsite for 1.5 to 2 hours before descending to Satsar pass through the Satsar stream. We re-group for lunch on the bank of a lake just across the pass before carrying on for another hour to our campsite today. Depending on the season, there are 4 or 5 lakes with water. The Satsar army check post is located on the right side of the hill, above the ridge. It is the LOC's third line of defense. The same identity verification, data collection, and questioning procedures apply here. Finish this today to ensure a clean day of trekking tomorrow. The first of the Satsar lakes is situated ten minutes from the army camp. The lake is very big, and it is set in a beautiful green setting with mountains in the background

Day 6: Trek from Satsar to Gangbal and campsite at Nundkul Lake
Today we trek towards the Nundkol and Gangbal twin lakes. Our initial climb takes us to Zach pass at 4100 m, where we can see the Harmukh mountain looming over the Nundkol and Gangbal twin lakes. We take a break for lunch along a small stream before ascending to the Nundkol campsite through a small ridge with views of the lakes

Day 7: Buffer day at Gangbal Lake
This day is an extra day or buffer day (counted as 8D-7N trek) for those who want to take rest for the entire day and that will be charged an extra 3200Rs per person (exclusive from 15,500)

Day 8: Trek from Gangbal Lake to Naranag and back drive to Srinagar
Today is our last day in the wilderness, and we're heading back to civilization. We begin with a gradual ascent out of the valley, then descend towards the tree line to reach a forested trail that leads to a Tea-shop, where we will stop for lunch. After that, it is a three-hour steep descent to Naranag, an ancient temple settlement, and a road-head that connects to Srinagar. Move your luggage to the waiting vehicles, then relax and enjoy the ride to Srinagar.
