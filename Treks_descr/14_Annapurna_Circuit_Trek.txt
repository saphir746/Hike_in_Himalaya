# Annapurna Circuit Trek

What The Great Gatsby is to literature, Annapurna Circuit is to trekking – a classic! It is christened as the ‘world’s greatest trek’ with fine reason – a title it’s earned and retained over all these years since the route first opened in 1977. From the highest mountains to the deepest gorges, the longest suspension bridges swaying to the overzealous winds to crossing the most scenic settlements in high mountains with deep valleys, the greenest lands thick with forests to regions as dry as dust and bone – this trek is 155 kms of sheer awe. Starting from the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu, you are in the middle of giants on touchdown into the country. Following the drama of the Marsyangdi River as it unhesitatingly cuts its way through the Himalayas, the trail takes you through two separate river valleys crossing over from one to the other through the highest point of the trek, Thorang La Pass – which lies at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of 5,416M
