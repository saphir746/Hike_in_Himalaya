# Chandranahan Lake Trek

Chandranahan lake trek is known to a handful of people as its not high on the popularity charts when compared with treks like Kedarkantha, Dayara Bugyal, and more. But, don't make the mistake of thinking that it is any less adventurous, fun, or appealing in comparison to those mentioned here. Now, Chandranahan lake is not just like any other lakes but it has historical, mythological, and geographical significance as well.  It is believed that Chandranahan lake's location is the exact place where Goddess Kali used to stay, back in the day, and is also known as her holy abode. Adding to that, it is also the birthplace of  Devta Shikru Maharaj, who holds a very important place in the eyes of locals and devotees. The name of this place has an interesting story as well. And according to the legend, it says that Chandra Dev visits this place for a ritual bath every 10 years. This is why the place is called Chandra-Nahan meaning, Bath of Chandra.
