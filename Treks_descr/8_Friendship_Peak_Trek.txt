# Friendship Peak Trek

A springboard for hardcore mountaineering, Friendship Peak runs in some influential circles. Nestled comfortably in between all the biggies from the two major ranges - Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar, Friendship Peak is an amphitheater for the tallest mountains in both these ranges. With a bird’s eye view of Manali from the col, to the mountain ranges in Lahaul from its peak; Friendship peak faces Hanuman Tibba on the one side and finds as its neighbours, giants such as Indrasan, Deo Tibba, Priyadarshani, the Seven Sisters to name a few. The Friendship Peak trek is more than just a pretty view from the top. Standing tall at 5289 M, it falls in the largest range of the Lesser Himalayas - the Pir Panjal. Apart from humbly standing its ground in the midst of the 6000ers, we especially are in awe of the trail of the trek which takes us through the most mesmerizing visuals. We encounter alpine meadows, thick forests and wide clearings, crossings over icy cold mountain streams - and of course a thick bed of shimmering white snow - all packed in 34 kms. It has stunning campsites full of local wildlife and bursts of colors, waiting to be wandered and explored.  Even the landscape buried under a thick sheet of snow is anything but wearisome to look at.

## Detailed Itinerary

Day 1: Manali Arrival
The squad is set to arrive in Manali by 11 a.m. today. This day holds significant importance, not only for acclimatization but also for assembling as a team to secure essential expedition permits. Although Friendship Peak is categorized as a trekking peak by the IMF, the current protocol in the Manali region mandates that the team submit an intimation along with ID proofs of all participants and guides. To facilitate trekking in the upper Himalayan regions, the IMF has established a regional office in Manali. After obtaining the intimation from this office, two additional permits will be needed—one from the BRO and the other from the SDM. These permits are essential for driving on the road between Solang Nala and Dhundi. If these permits are not secured, the team will need to cover the 7-kilometer distance between Solang Nala and Dhundi on foot, following a scenic path along the riverbank. The team will stay in shared accommodations in Manali, spending their evenings bonding, preparing for the upcoming trek, and building a better understanding of one another

Day 2: From Manali towards Dhundi to Bakkarthatch, a 21km trek
Today, we leave early in the morning in a car for Dhundi, arriving at 8 a.m. Today, mules will transport our common luggage and rations to Bakkarthatch, where we will set up base camp. Today's hike is relatively straightforward, with a gradual incline. In Dhundi, we pass across 3-4 fixed camps where “sailanis” should be visible during the year. The trail begins on the real left bank of the Beas River, which runs parallel the trail during the day. We soon come to a wooden bridge with no “railings.” If you have a fear of water, this bridge may be a little scary for you. We continue walking along the lush green path on the real right bank of the Beas River from here

Day 3: From Bakarthatch towards ABC at Lady Leg
We'll get up at 6.30 a.m. today because we need to get to ABC early for camp set-up and to practise Snowcraft. We arrive at our camp early enough, about 11.30 a.m., after a light breakfast, to have a hot lunch there. We'll now set up the team's camps here and take a short break for a couple of hours. Since AMS sets in quickly, no sleep is recommended as early as now. If the weather permits, we will switch our Snowcarft to the snow stretches in front of the campsite in the afternoon. Today, we'll discover a few important things – On thick snow, ascending and falling, Using an ice axe as a temporary anchor, ice axe self-arrest, roping up, and using advanced mountaineering equipmentDay 4: From Load ferry towards Camp 1We'll transport our summit loads to Camp 1 today. This will help us achieve our acclimatization goals. We'll stay at Camp 1 for a while before returning to ABC in the evening

Day 5: Acclimatization Day and Move towards Camp 1 Distance 2 Kms
The morning of the day is set aside for practising the craft we learned the day before. In the afternoon, we'll start heading towards our Summit Camp. The hike to the Summit Camp, where we set up our tents, is just about an hour long. We climb a little higher from the big hum, where we set up our Summit camp for acclimatisation, and then descend to the Summit Camp to rest. If there isn't enough snow, Summit Camp could be set up higher. The aim is to reduce the amount of time it takes to reach the summit

Day 6: From Summit Attempt and back towards Base Camp
This is the day we've all been waiting for to put together this display! We begin about 2 a.m., fully equipped with snow boots, gaiters, harness, helmet, and head torch. Around 9 or 10 a.m., one could arrive at the summit. Celebrate your achievement and take photos, but keep in mind that the Summit's platform isn't very broad. It's crucial to arrive early (around 10 a.m.) so the return journey is also long. Descent would become impossible once the snow became slushy. Fix rope is needed once more when climbing down to the shoulder. When we near our Summit Camp, we catch our breath and get a bite to eat. We immediately dismantle our tents and make our way to the ABC. We will switch to Base Camp on the same day if the squad has enough stamina after the celebratory lunch at ABC. The descent will only take 2 – 3 hours, and the luxury of Basecamp could be very appealing

Day 7: From Base Camp towards Dhundi to Manali
From the Basecamp, we retrace our steps back to Dhundi and take a vehicle to Manali. The evening has been set aside for a grand Summit party.
