# Bhrigu Lake Trek

A lot of trekkers do the Bhrigu Lake trek for the lake is steeped in mythology. This trek lies in Himachal Pradesh, around 20 km north of Manali and can be accessed from Gulaba. It is known as the place where the famous saint Maharishi Bhrigu sat in deep meditation. However, we believe the lake is not the only thing the trek has to offer. You must do the Bhrigu Lake trek for its grasslands.To enter an alpine meadow in our country, one has to often spend at least a day or two trekking within the tree line. We are talking about two or three days of hard ascent. This is because most alpine meadows start at around 11,000 ft above the treeline. However, on this trek, you are in the meadows within the first 10 minutes of this trek! Imagine having meadows such as these right in your backyard. No wonder we go gaga over landscapes that are seen in places like Switzerland.

## Detailed Itinerary

Day 1: Arrive at Manali. Drive from Manali to Gulaba Roadhead, and Trek to Jonker ThatchThe Bhrigu Lake trek begins at Gulaba. The 24 km route to Gulaba takes you on the Manali-Rohtang Pass road, past Kolang, Palchan and Kothi. You get fabulous views of pine forests and mountains as soon as you cross Kothi.
            Once a quiet hamlet, Gulaba is now buzzing with tourists in transit to Rohtang Pass.
            Vehicles drop you off at the road and head near the Gulaba check post.
            Trek steadily underneath forest cover, passing through open grasslands now and then. You will reach the Jonker Thatch campsite in about an hour and fifteen minutes

Day 2: Trek from Jonker Thatch to Rola KholiThe trail begins with a steep ascent. Make note of brown oak, cedar and birch trees on the trail here. These are a few of the most prominent trees in the Himalayas. After around 20 minutes, the trail enters an open meadow where shepherds camp. Observe Mt Hanuman Tibba towering over the meadow in the background. Below Hanuman Tibba are the Seven Sister peaks seated in the Beas Kund Valley. Turn right from the upper ridge of the meadow and head south. The second forested cover begins here. Rola Kholi is a scenic grazing ground used by local shepherds. Located at the base of Bhrigu Lake, it makes for an ideal camping spot. The water source here is Chor Nallah, which flows across the camping ground

Day 3: Trek from Rola Kholi to Bhrigu Lake, and back to Rola KholiStart early as you have a lot of distance to cover today. You have to trek a height of around 1,348 ft to reach Bhrigu Lake.
            Bhrigu Lake rests between two high-altitude ridges. You begin with hiking to the first ridge, which is an hour away. In June, the trail is usually covered in snow. In July, as the snow melts on the lower reaches, you see the trail slowly turning from green to brown and white. As you reach the ridge, look for an oval glacial lake in the distance. Depending on the season, the lake is either surrounded by snow or fresh grass, along with alpine flowers.
            "If you climb over the ridge on the side of Bhrigu Lake and look down, you see the three campsites of Hampta Pass trek - Chikha, Jwara, and Balu ka Ghera -  laid out in front of you. But be careful as you climb over the ridge. From the edge, it is a nerve-wracking steep drop into the valley," says Arjun Majumdar, Founder and CEO.
            On a clear day, you can catch a stunning panoramic view of the Pir Pinjal and Dhauladhar ranges. Also, major peaks such as Indrasen, Deo Tibba and Hanuman Tibba stand majestically before you. The lake is normally enveloped in fog which can make finding the route tricky. It is always advisable to hire a local guide.
            After spending time at the lake, retrace your way to Rola Kholi

Day 4: Trek from Rola Kholi to Gulaba. Drive back to ManaliTodayâ€™s trek is an easy one. You get back to Gulaba through the meadows you came up from. The descent can be a bit steep but is good on your legs given you are always in the meadows. It takes 3-4 hours to reach Gulaba. Gulaba at around 9,875 ft is a better exit for your knees and feet as compared to Vasisht at 7,000 ft.
